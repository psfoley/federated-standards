What is an FSP?
===============

FSP stands for Federated Standard Proposal. The FSP format is strongly modeled after the 
Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) and Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP)
processes - which includes verbiage in this document. 
A FSP is a design document that provides information to the Federated Learning community,
about a common framework standard or component. The FSP
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature.

We intend FSPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing common standards,
for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into common FL standards.  The FSP 
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the FSPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal. This historical record is available by the normal git
commands for retrieving older revisions, and can also be browsed
`on GitHub <https://github.com/securefederatedai/federated-standards>`__.

FSP Audience
============

The typical primary audience for FSPs are the core developers of federated learning 
frameworks, with input from academic researchers, industry, other community stakeholders.  

However, other parts of the federated learning community may also choose to use the process
(particularly for Informational FSPs) to document expected API conventions and
to manage complex design coordination problems that require collaboration across
multiple projects.

FSP Types
=========

There are three kinds of FSPs:


1. An **Informational** FSP describes a common design issue, or
   provides general guidelines or information to the federated learning
   community, but does not propose a new standard.  Informational FSPs do not
   necessarily represent a FL community consensus or
   recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore
   Informational FSPs or follow their advice.

2. A **Standards Track** FSP describes an interoperability standard that 
   will be supported by two federated learning frameworks. Approval from 
   from two identified federated learning framework representitives is needed 
   before an FSP PR can be merged. 

3. A **Component Implementation** FSP goes one step further than the 
   standards track and provides a reference implementation of the feature described.
   Closure of an component implementation FSP PR requires two links to
   FL Framework PRs that implement that component. 

Because the barrier to Standards Track and Component Implementation FSPs is high,
we expect many FSP to start as Informational, graduate to Standards Track with a new PR,
and finally become Component Implementation once FL framework authors have reached agreement.
